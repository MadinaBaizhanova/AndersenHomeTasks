Homework: practise with Git

Create a new repository. If you already have one - just use it instead.

Add the code from the Homework #2 to this repository. It should appear in your main/master branch.

Do the following:
• Create a separate branch called develop from main.
• Create a feature branch. The task number is JFB-1
• In a feature branch, create a [Ticket Service] class that stores 10 Tickets and has a function that can return a ticket by ID.
• The first Git commit should contain a ticket storage.
• The second Git commit - the function.
• Push develop the feature branch to the remote repository
• Create MR from the feature branch to develop, don’t merge it! Leave it for the check

*** Cooperate with your teammate (another person from the Group).
• Clone his repository to your local computer.
• Create another feature branch from your teammate’s develop branch. The task number is JFB-2
• In this branch add a new function to the [Ticket Service]. The function should return tickets by [stadium sector].
• Push the changes to the remote repository and create MR from the feature branch to develop
• Ask your teammate to review your code and add one comment to the MR.
• Leave the MR for the check. Your teammate should do the same work in your repository.
****
• Together with your teammate, create MR from the feature branch to develop with a Merge Conflict
