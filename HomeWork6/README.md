Homework: Documentation for tickets system
Create a [BusTicketService] class with the following list of capabilities:
1) Create a [BusTicket] for a specified date and type.
2) Store a ticket in an in-memory storage.
3) Remove a ticket from the storage by ID.
4) Get ticket by ID
5) Search tickets by type and price (from price A to price B)
   
Cover the class and its functions with Java docs where needed.
If you think that the code is “self-explainable” - don’t add docs.
